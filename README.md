### Hello, I am VÃ­ctor Velasco RÃ­os

- I studied economics and I like computers, animals and tranquility.
- I am currently migrating to the wonderful world of GNU/LInux and working on some public projects which I hope will be useful to someone.
- I do not usually collaborate because I like to work at my own pace, however, you are free to contact me with any questions, clarifications or proposals through the indicated email.
- In economics I really like applied economics and computers, I am specialized in data analysis using tools such as R, Python, Matlab and Julia (in development). I also really like data science, however, so far, I have no formal education in this field beyond common courses and algorithms.
- I really like automation and visualizations, you can find out more about this on my website: [https://vjvelascorios.netlify.app/](https://vjvelascorios.netlify.app/)
- As I mentioned before, you can contact me via email ðŸ“«.
- Btw, sorry for the mistakes in english is not my mother tongue and to be honest until now I never really study the language as should be, so, be patient, please, I promise to improve. :)

Next, the less cringy paraphrase that chatgpt did xd:

- I've delved into the world of economics while nurturing interests in computers, animals, and a peaceful existence.
- Currently, I'm venturing into the realm of GNU/Linux and working on public projects that I hope will benefit others.
- I typically work at my own pace, but feel free to reach out via email for questions, clarifications, or proposals.
- My passion lies in applied economics and data analysis, using tools like R, Python, Matlab, and (in development) Julia. While I have a strong interest in data science, my formal education in this field is limited to common courses and algorithms.
- Automation and data visualization are my forte. You can learn more on my website: https://vjvelascorios.netlify.app/
- As mentioned earlier, don't hesitate to contact me via email.
