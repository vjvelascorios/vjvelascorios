### Hello, I am Víctor Velasco Ríos

- I studied economics and I like computers, animals and tranquility.
- I am currently migrating to the wonderful world of GNU/LInux and working on some public projects which I hope will be useful to someone.
- I do not usually collaborate because I like to work at my own pace, however, you are free to contact me with any questions, clarifications or proposals through the indicated email.
- In economics I really like applied economics and computers, I am specialized in data analysis using tools such as R, Python, Matlab and Julia (in development). I also really like data science, however, so far, I have no formal education in this field beyond common courses and algorithms.
- I really like automation and visualizations, you can find out more about this on my website: [https://vjvelascorios.netlify.app/](https://vjvelascorios.netlify.app/)
- As I mentioned before, you can contact me via email 📫.
